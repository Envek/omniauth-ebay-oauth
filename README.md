## Preface

> Why do I need it? There are a couple of other gems with OmniAuth strategies for eBay?

eBay has two different authorization methods: Auth'n'auth and OAuth. Technically, they are both uses OAuth2 protocol (just to embrace a little confusion).

This gem implements authorization with OAuth method while currently available gems (like [ebay_request](https://github.com/gzigzigzeo/ebay_request) or [omniauth-ebay](https://github.com/TheGiftsProject/omniauth-ebay)) implements Auth'n'auth.

__What is the difference? Access tokens!__

With Auth'n'auth you will get a single token which you can use to access old eBay XML APIs (Trading API, etc.)

With OAuth, you will get a pair of access and refresh tokens which can be used to access new eBay REST APIs (Buy API, Sell API, etc.)

However, you can use new OAuth tokens to access old APIs by providing an access token in (not yet) documented HTTP header `X-EBAY-API-IAF-TOKEN` (like this gem uses it to obtain information about an authenticated user from Trading API).

If you plan to use only old APIs, you can look at [ebay_request](https://github.com/gzigzigzeo/ebay_request) gem.

If you plan to use new APIs, you are welcome to use this gem either standalone or together with [ebay_api](https://github.com/nepalez/ebay_api) client get for REST APIs.

Now you can read the eBay docs about [REST APIs](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/ebay-rest-landing.html) and [OAuth](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-quick-ref-user-tokens.html) and then proceed toâ€¦


## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-ebay-oauth'
```

Then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```


## Usage

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ebay, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, callback_url: RU_NAME,
    sandbox: false, scope: 'https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope' # redefining additional default options
end
```

Required options:
  - __CLIENT_ID__, __CLIENT_SECRET__ - Your application's [OAuth credentials](<https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-credentials.html>) for the environment you're targeting.
  - __callback_url__  - Your application's [RuName](<https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-runame.html>) for the environment you're targeting.

Additional options:
  - __sandbox__ - Are you running your application in [sandbox mode](<https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/sandbox-landing.html>), default __`true`__.
  - __scope__ - A list of [OAuth scopes](<https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-details.html#scopes>) that provide access to the interfaces you call, default: __`[]`__. If you want change scopes you could pass it as string or as array of scopes like so: `['https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.marketing.readonly', 'https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account.readonly']`
  - __read_timeout__ - Number of seconds to wait for one block to be read for Auth'n'auth eBay API requests, default is 60.
  - \+ all [OmniAuth](<https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth>) supported options, like: `callback_path`, `provider_ignores_state` and so on.

Additional usage information could be found on [OmniAuth README page](<https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth#integrating-omniauth-into-your-application>).


## Minimal working Sinatra application:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'omniauth-ebay-oauth'

use Rack::Session::Cookie
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ebay, ENV['EBAY_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    callback_url: ENV['EBAY_RU_NAME']
end

get '/' do
  redirect '/auth/ebay'
end

get '/auth/ebay/callback' do
  "Hello, #{request.env['omniauth.auth'].dig('info', 'name')}"
end
```


## Development

To pass your code through the all checks you simply need to run:

```
bundle exec rake
```
